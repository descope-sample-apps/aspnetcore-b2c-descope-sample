## Configuring Authentication Settings

Open `appsettings.json` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual Azure AD B2C settings:

- **ClientId**: Your Azure AD B2C application client ID.
- **ClientSecret**: Your Azure AD B2C application Client Secret. You can generate one by following this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications#create-a-client-secret).
- **Domain**: Your Azure AD B2C domain.
- **SignUpSignInPolicyId**: Your Azure AD B2C sign-up/sign-in policy ID.

> **Note:** Since this is an ASP.NET Core application, the app is considered a confidential client and is therefore capable of storing a client secret securely.
